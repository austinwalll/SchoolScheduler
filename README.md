This was a full stack project written in Java on Android Studio where I created an application to keep track of my school terms. 
It allows users to enter pertinent information about courses and assignments and set alerts to go off even when the application is actively running.
It also allows users to send notes to others from the app, utilizing the android send feature.
The application utilizes a SQLite database to store three different entities, terms, courses, and assessments.
